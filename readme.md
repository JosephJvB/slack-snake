# Me make snake robot for slack

### TIL:
 - https://github.com/os/slacker: I can have my bot send commands with `chat.command`
    - user types !whom @user
    - my bot message JukeBot in a private chat and check if guess was correct
    - I can tell the user to guess again, whatever, 3 guesses, then reveal later? Something like that.
    - Not much benefit to gain from it though I think, to be honest. But I now know I can do that.
- Enzo used a slack app: Simple Poll.
    - used an 'rich-embed' with buttons, like fancy emoji responses
    - also something I can do
