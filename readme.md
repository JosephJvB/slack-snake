# Me make snake robot for slack

barry issues with token permissions:
https://api.slack.com/methods/users.profile.set
https://api.slack.com/scopes
https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics
https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth

since we cant update username easily is there another gimmick i can apply to a barry user?
